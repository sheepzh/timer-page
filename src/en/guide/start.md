You can quickly start using this extension in just 3 easy steps.

## 1. Pin the icon

Firstly, to use this extension more conveniently, you'd better pin it. It's not the same in different browsers to do this, the following figure shows how in Chrome.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <img src="/images/pin.png" width=400 />
</div>

## 2. Browse any website

Then, browse any website, and you will see that the time is beating on the icon, just like this <img src="/images/beating.gif" style="display: inline-block;height: 24px;"/>.

## 3. Read data in the popup page

Finally, click the icon to open the popup page, and you can read the data visualized with pie chart, of today, this week or this month.

And you can access all features by clicking on the link at the bottom of this page.
